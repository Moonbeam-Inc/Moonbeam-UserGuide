Whiteboard
----------


   •	The whiteboard is a freehand whiteboard like the Widget Board whiteboard. 
   
      
      o	    The VR controllers mimic the action of marker onto whiteboard. 


   •	To draw on the whiteboard, approach the board and raise your controllers close to the board. A drawing tool will automatically appear in your hand.


   •	To erase content on the whiteboard, face your palms upward near the board and an eraser will automatically appear in your hand. (In development)


   •	Along the sides of the whiteboard, you will find color palletes. Press the trigger over the desired color to select it. 
   

      o	    The color of the marker will change and confirm the selection. 


   •	To save what has been drawn, press the "Email a Snapshot" button below the board in order to send it to the email address associated with your Moonbeam account.


   •	More whiteboards can be spawned into the room by Quest users by looking down at their left wrist panel and selecting 
   

   -    Whiteboard is persistent; When leaving and re-entering room, the whiteboard will remain the same as the user leaves it
